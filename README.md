### Best quantile algorithms for data streams

GK and Random are available.
implemented by Lu Wang <coolwanglu@gmail.com>

To build the code, you need the Boost C++ Library and a compiler which supports C++11

Part of the work *"Quantile over Data Streams: An Experimental Study"*

Slides of the work can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/coolwanglu/quantiles-over-data-streams-an-experimental-study), 
which describes a (much) simplified version of the algorithm.
